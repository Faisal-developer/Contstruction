										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Covid-19 has impacted not only our work lives but our work spaces. Nearly two years have passed since the virus was first detected, and in that time multiple strains have caused numerous lockdowns, travel bans, and tragic loss of life. And with a new and potentially virulent strain detected – designated Omicron – it’s no surprise that employees are raising concerns about the need to return to office for work. How can workplaces guarantee their safety and wellbeing?</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>According to a recent poll conducted by the BBC, 70% of the general public believe employees will “never return to offices at the same rate” as before the pandemic.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this is a staggeringly large statistic (bolstered by 79% of senior business leaders who believe the same), there remain many who posit that offices will always carry important benefits. For instance, they help keep work life separate from personal life. They serve as a physical representation of a company’s culture and ambitions. And, importantly, offices are where the spirit of collaboration manifests – where people are united in a common purpose and learn from and support each other. The same BBC poll found that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-58559179">62%</a> of the general public felt that “young workers working from home will struggle more to progress in their career than going into the office”.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that businesses need to address these challenges, and that workplaces need to adapt. So what should be done? What are the important considerations to keep in mind for the offices of the future?</p>
<h2><b>Immediate Concerns</b></h2>
<p>Employers have a duty of care to minimise the risk of Covid-19 transmission in their office spaces. The best way to do that is by understanding how the virus spreads, conducting a thorough and vetted <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/risk-assessment.htm">risk assessment</a>, and then putting into place safety measures. We know Covid-19 is transmitted in three ways: via person-to-person contact, air droplets, or contact with a contaminated surface. So employers should focus on three key areas: <strong>distance</strong>, <strong>circulation</strong>, and <strong>surfaces</strong>.</p>
<h3>Distance</h3>
<p>Distance refers to the 6ft/2m social distancing rule. In its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-two-metre-social-distancing-guidance/review-of-two-metre-social-distancing-guidance">review</a> of this rule, the government found that “there are severe economic costs to maintaining 2 metre distancing” in office spaces but that the “relative risk [of transmitting or contracting Covid-19] may be 2-10 times higher at 1 metre than 2 metres without mitigations”.</p>
<p>The updated guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/offices-factories-and-labs#offices-1-2">working safely during Covid-19</a> offers solutions that take into account both points. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where practical, maximising the space between desks</li>
<li>Adopting a designated seating system</li>
<li>Assigning fixed teams or partners to minimise exposure</li>
<li>“Hot desking” (where multiple people are assigned a desk on a rota, with each person cleaning the desk and equipment thoroughly at the end of their shift so the desk is safe and ready to be used by the next colleague)</li>
<li>Where there are space constraints, using screens, barriers or workplace enclosures to separate people from each other</li>
</ul>
<p>Businesses with an <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/benefits-of-an-open-plan-office-layout/">open plan office layout</a> might find it easy to tackle distance. Those offices with a smaller footprint should seriously consider implementing the above solutions – so employees can work without worrying about falling ill.</p>
<h3>Circulation</h3>
<p>Circulation refers to ventilation. With research showing that a room with fresh air can reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission by as much as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-film-shows-importance-of-ventilation-to-reduce-spread-of-covid-19">70%</a>, ventilation is key to office safety.</p>
<p>The British Council for Offices or BCO is a leading forum for discussing issues related to office spaces. They published a guide this year on <a href="https://www.bco.org.uk/Research/Publications/Thoughts_on_Ventilation_Design_and_Operation_Post_Covid-19-_Supplement.aspx">ventilation design and operation</a> which provides recommendations for business owners.</p>
<p>Some of the solutions proposed by such bodies and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/offices-factories-and-labs">government</a> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying poorly ventilated areas within an office by using CO2 monitors</li>
<li>Providing a natural air-circulation system by opening windows and doors for short periods of time throughout the day to allow for fresh air to circulate throughout the office</li>
<li>Taking advantage of an open office floor plan</li>
<li>Using a Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning or HVAC system which does not recycle air but increases air changes per hour</li>
<li>Where practical, having comfortable and fully equipped outdoor workspaces</li>
</ul>
<p>The above are relatively easy to implement, and effective in minimising the transmission of Covid-19 via air droplets.</p>
<h3>Surfaces</h3>
<p>Surfaces can be broken down into three elements: furniture, walls, floors. All of which are linked to a comprehensive cleaning system.</p>
<p>Office furniture will need to be easy to move and easy to clean. This will allow for flexible layouts and good hygiene. Likewise, walls and floors must be made of materials that are easy to disinfect. Guidance – in the form of posters or stickers – should be used on walls and floors to educate employees on simple steps they can take to reduce the transmission of Covid-19. For example, signs on bathroom walls which clearly explain the steps needed to properly wash one’s hands. Or stickers on the floor which indicate one-way walking systems to prevent people from bumping into each other.</p>
<p>Consider implementing a comprehensive cleaning system. Frequently used equipment or furniture should be cleaned after use, with adequate disposal arrangement in place. And employees should have easy access to cleaning equipment and supplies.</p>
<h2><b>Long-term considerations</b></h2>
<p>Covid-19 has impacted the design of existing office spaces. It’s more than likely it will impact the design of future office spaces. Architects and designers are using this period as an opportunity for experimentation – to play with office space in novel ways that balance functionality with wellbeing, unity with safety. Employees need to return to spaces that are not simply sterile but invigorating and inspiring as well.</p>
<p>The Guardian reported on a Mind survey of 40,000 staff across 114 organisations, which found the wellbeing of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/03/stress-test-burnout-breaks-staff-recover-pandemic">41%</a> of employees had worsened during the pandemic. In the US, the figures are just as stark. A Visier survey found that burnout is sharply on the rise, with <a href="https://www.visier.com/blog/trends/new-survey-70-percent-burnt-out-employees-would-leave-current-job/">89%</a> of employees reporting they experienced it in 2021, and 70% open to leaving their current job as a result of it. And so from a business perspective, especially from an HR perspective, it is essential that the office spaces of the future are built on the pillars of wellbeing, safety and flexibility. Otherwise there appears to be a genuine risk of businesses succumbing to high turnover and low productivity rates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">“Where people can see their employer has taken well considered and appropriate steps to protect them and support their wellbeing with physical workplace measures or increased flexibility for remote working, it helps them to feel safer and more valued. This in turn contributes to a culture where trust and mutual respect can flourish and people naturally feel happier and more engaged with their organisation, driving greater levels of motivation and productivity.” &#8211; <strong>Alex Arundale, Chief People Officer, <a href="https://www.oneadvanced.com/solutions/cloud-hr/">Advanced HR Software</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’re already seeing measures being taken to ensure safety. And in terms of office design and wellbeing, there are businesses across the world which are now trying some or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relaxation rooms where employees are made to feel safe and comfortable</li>
<li>Using plants and soft furnishings to make the office space feel more homely</li>
<li>Designing residentially inspired office spaces, drawing upon the layouts and décor of cafés, bars or restaurants to make work spaces more appealing to employees</li>
</ul>
<p>A key takeaway here – one that’s not new – is that when considering <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/what-does-an-effective-office-layout-look-like/">what makes an effective office layout</a> and design, it’s absolutely vital businesses understand their employees’ needs first. And in terms of recent employees’ needs, there is a clear shift in priorities.</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics found that <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/businessandindividualattitudestowardsthefutureofhomeworkinguk/apriltomay2021">85%</a> of working adults currently homeworking want a “hybrid” approach involving both home and office working in the future. And the BBC reported on the results found by flexible work consultancy firm Timewise, which found that “<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-59211233">9 in 10</a> people say they want flexibility in their next position.”</p>
<p>The buzzword being used now in conjunction with employee needs and future offices is <strong>hybrid</strong> work spaces. These are flexible work spaces – ones which might have a smaller footprint but are capable of accommodating employees working in office as well as from home, bridging the two via technology and specially designed collaborative spaces built on the safety principles of distance, circulation and surfaces.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the idea behind hybrid work spaces is to reframe the notion that going to the office is an obligation but rather an option – hopefully an appealing one at that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For construction companies, fit-outs are a common occurrence. But for those enlisting a fit-out professional to provide these services, deciphering the different kinds of fit-out available, and what each entails, is easier said than done.</p>
<p>In this blog post, principal contractors Eden London provide their expertise to explain what a shell and core fit-out is, how it differs from other popular fit-out options and why they might be.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, let’s start with a basic definition of what we mean by ‘fit-out’. A fit-out is a term used by construction companies to refer to the interior refurbishment of <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/projects/commercial/">commercial, </a>industrial, or <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/projects/residential/">residential</a> spaces, making them suitable for use.</p>
<p><a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/services/category-a-fit-outs/">Cat A</a> and <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/services/category-b-fit-outs/">Cat B fit-outs</a> are perhaps the most commonly known of the fit-outs. In these instances, the ‘shell’ of the building is already completed and the fit-out company is tasked with doing up the interior. But occasionally, the firm may need to take charge of the shell as well.</p>
<h2>What is a shell and core fit-out?</h2>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/cat-a-cat-b-fit-out-guide/">Cat A and Cat B fit-outs</a>, shell and core fit-outs involve building the project’s basic structure–or ‘shell’.</p>
<p>In every construction project where a new structure is erected, the first thing to go up is the fundamental base or structure, known as the ‘shell’ or base build. This shell typically includes the framework and envelope of the building as well as key services such as mains water, gas and electric supply.</p>
<p>But other than that, there’s little more to list for what’s included in a shell and core fit out. Other than the basics of a building, things yet to be installed at this fit-out level include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suspended ceilings</li>
<li>Flooring</li>
<li>Wall coverings</li>
<li>Partitions</li>
<li>Lighting</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why have a shell and core fit-out?</h2>
<p>It’s fair to say that when you opt for a shell and core fit out, you really are getting the basics. Unlike Cat A and Cat B options, shell and core fit-outs are far from ready to be occupied.</p>
<p>However, they are becoming increasingly popular, particularly for office lettings. The reason for this is that it allows tenants to put their stamp on the space right back to the brick—quite literally.</p>
<p>Construction providers often provide properties, such as <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/projects/office-fit-outs/">office</a> spaces to Cat A, or even Cat B fit out standards, ready for selling or letting. But due to the variety of tastes of prospective buyers and renters, it’s hard to please everyone. Simply put, the easiest way to overcome this was to let tenants make the decisions on everything needed to get their property ready for purpose.</p>
<p>From ceiling tiles to carpets, it’s now common practice for construction firms to leave these decisions up to the tenant. Often offering a rent-free period to complete the property to habitable standards, shell and core fit-outs are a popular option with those wishing to put their own touch on their space.</p>
<h2>Contact Eden London</h2>
<p>Are you considering opting for a shell and core fit out for your premises? Ensuring it’s completed to the highest possible standard is vital to the lasting quality of your space. <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/contact-us/">Contact Eden London</a>, a <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/about/accreditations/">fully accredited</a><a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/what-is-the-role-of-a-principal-contractor-in-construction-projects/"> principal contractor</a> specialising in shell and core fit-outs in London and Essex, to find out how we can help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For clients, being able to trust a contractor to complete their construction project to the deadline and without going over budget is an essential part of building a strong client-contractor relationship and achieving a smooth-running, stress free project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eden London has a reputation for completing projects on-time and on-budget. Read on to find out more about how we ensure we deliver this on every project we undertake.</span></p>
<h2>Eden’s promise</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For prospects looking for a contractor to manage their project, there’s a few crucial criteria that must be met. The critical promise contractors need to be able to make is to complete works to a high standard, <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/financial/">on-time and on-budget</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Eden London, we pride ourselves on our ability to give customers accurate quotes and forecasts for their projects, so they have peace of mind that their project will not overrun and they will not overspend from day one right through to completion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike larger construction firms, Eden London is not interested in levering more money from its clients. Our focus is on maintaining high satisfaction and retaining our clients&#8217; custom. This is why we provide a concrete promise that we will complete projects as agreed, taking the budgetary and deadline stress out of the entire process for our clients.</span></p>
<h2>How we do it</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large-scale construction and fit out projects often throw up the unexpected, which can result in delays and additional costs. This can lead many prospective clients to view the initial quote for their project as a best-case scenario.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when you choose Eden London, you can rest assured that your project will not exceed the figure we quote in our consultation if the project plan stays unchanged. But how do we do it?</span></p>
<h3>We use an external surveyor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many construction companies have an in-house surveyor, whose role is focussed around extracting more money from each job through additional and unnecessary suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eden London works with independent surveyors on our projects. They provide an unbiased review of the works required, and the steps needed to complete them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows us to draw up a realistic cost for the project, based on the exact work needed for each project.</span></p>
<h3>We create a detailed plan</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the advice of the surveyor and our years of experience in the construction industry, we create a highly detailed plan for each project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For every project, we outline the stages of completion, the cost of each stage and the time required to do so. This allows us to create buffer points for each stage of the construction, which will cover the client in the event of unforeseen delays, additional costs or changes to the project—all things which other firms add on as extra costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This process provides us with a detailed blueprint of the entire project, allowing us to accurately determine the time-scale for works to be completed and the cost of this for the client. Once the project is running we, as the principal contractor, conduct strict management of subcontractors in line with our schedule to ensure everything runs like clockwork. </span></p>
<h2>Our promise in action</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our promise isn’t just words on paper, it’s visible in every project we complete. Over the past three years, Eden London has led 50 projects—and we are proud to say that every one of those has been on-time and on-budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our years of experience, knowledge and project management skills mean that we can confidently take on projects in all areas of construction from £10,000 to £2million and deliver high quality results, while meeting the unique budgets, deadlines and demands of each client.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous projects evidence our “on-time and on-budget” promise in action. For more information, why not take a look at Eden London’s </span><a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/testimonials/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">client testimonials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking to finish the interior of your space, it’s vital to enlist a fit out specialist who can bring your vision to life and exceed your expectations. Whether you’re putting the finishing touches to a newly built office, or updating an existing space, Eden London are experienced fit out contractors who can create a tailored fit out experience to meet your needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve put together a comprehensive guide on <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/services/category-a-fit-outs/">Cat A</a> and <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/services/category-b-fit-outs/">Cat B</a> fit outs, so you can determine what kind of fit out your interior space requires, and what is involved in the process.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a fit out? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fit out is a term used in the construction industry. Essentially, a fit out is a service which includes activities that prepare an interior space suitable for occupation. The extent to which the interior space is prepared is determined by the level of fit out supplied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two main fit outs provided by contractors are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Category A fit out</strong></li>
<li><strong>Category B fit out</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a Cat A fit out?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cat A fit outs are the level of fit out provided for <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/projects/residential/">residential</a> and <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/projects/commercial/">commercial</a> landlords who are offering property in what is often referred to as a ‘white box’ or ‘shell’ state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no set checklist for what a Cat A fit out should and shouldn’t include, but it generally describes the level of fit out which brings the property up to the standard where it can be handed over for final completion in the form of decoration and furnishing. This means that spaces with a Cat A fit out are usually ‘empty’, ready for the tenant to put their personal stamp on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commonly, Cat A fit outs include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raised flooring</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suspended ceilings</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HVAC</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flooring</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchens and tea points</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiling</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decorating</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ceiling</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partitions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cubicle systems</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lift installation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DDA compliance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structural steel</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staircases</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a Cat B fit out?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Cat B fit out is the level of finish that follows on from a Cat A fit out. Once the interior of a property has reached the ‘white box’ stage, everything that comes after is part of a Cat B fit out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cat B fit outs bring your interior space up to a liveable and serviceable condition, which is fully finished ready for the tenant to move straight in. Cat B fit outs are generally considered the full-package, with everything from furniture to paint included.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cat B fit outs include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final finishes and branding</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Installation of offices</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Installation of specialist lighting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Installation of furniture</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raised flooring</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suspended ceilings</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bespoke joinery</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HVAC</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flooring</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchens and tea points</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiling</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decorating</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ceiling</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partitions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cubicle systems</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lift installation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DDA compliance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structural steel</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staircases</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reception desks</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What fit out do I require?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you require fit out services, it’s important to determine what level of fit out you need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a landlord looking to rent your space to tenants, the level of finish disclosed in the tenancy contract will determine the fit out required.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are offering your property in an ‘empty’ state, which the tenant can put their stamp on, this will be a </span><b>Cat A fit out</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are offering your property in a ready-to-move-in state, then this will be a </span><b>Cat B fit out</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/projects/office-fit-outs/">Office refurbishments</a> are a complex and time-consuming process, but one which can help breathe new life into your work environment. Keeping staff morale and productivity in the office high through refurbishment is a popular option, but one which takes time and good organisation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless you’re a professional refurbishment contractor, knowing exactly what needs to be done and all the things you need to think about when carrying out an office refurbishment is a big task. In this blog post, the team at Eden has put together the ultimate office refurbishment checklist to help see your office upgrade from start to finish in a smooth and stress-free way.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timing is everything</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting the timing right for your office refurbishment is vital to not only its success, but also to ensure minimal disruption to the team who work there. You need to sit down with all key decision-makers in your team to come to agreement on the best timing for your refurbishment project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the potential need for reconfigurations, painting and building work which could lead to excessive noise and dust which limit your employee’s access to the office, this is something crucial to get right for minimal down time of your team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, office refurbishments are particularly popular at times when offices have shut-downs or when all staff are away from the office, such as the Christmas period. Carrying out office updates during periods when your team are away from the office means that work isn’t disrupted and they come back after a refreshing holiday to a brand new office space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But be warned—the demand for office refurbishments during key periods mean that office fit out teams are booked up fast. To make sure you’re front on the queue for your office refurbishment when your staff have time off, you need to get in quick ans book your work far in advance.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outline the aims of your refurbishment</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why you’re carrying out an office refurbishment might seem obvious—to update and modernise your space. But there’s far more to it than simply redecorating what’s already there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From increased functionality of the office space to reconfiguration to improved lighting, knowing the desired outcome for your space before refurbishment starts is key. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the finer details, such as adding pops of colour, decor and furniture are important aspects to consider, having a complete checklist of exactly what you want your refurbishment to achieve before the construction team turn up to start the process is key to ensuring there’s enough time to fully explore and discuss the available options which your chosen contractors.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make time to crunch the numbers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve got big plans for your office space, it’s easy to get carried away. But taking time to crunch the numbers and set yourself a budget is imperative to getting everything you want and need done with the resources you have available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money doesn’t grow on trees and whatever your price point for the refurbishment project, there will be a need to do the calculations to ensure you come in on budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you choose to manage the cost of your project yourself or enlist the help of your office refurbishment contractors, knowing what you want to achieve and the budget you have to bring that vision to life needs to be established early on.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find your fit out team</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s hundreds of construction service providers in every corner of the UK, and each has their own specialisms. It’s important to find your perfect fit—and this means not opting for the first company you land on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the right team for your refurbishment project requires careful research into everything from services provided, the cost of these services, previous work and client testimonials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure you stay clear of the cowboys, and receive a high-standard office refurbishment sure to impress your office employees, investing the time and effort needed to find an accredited, tried-and-trusted <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/projects/office-fit-outs/">office fit out provider</a> is crucial to ensuring you get the expected result, on time and on budget.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With so many different <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/types-of-office-layout/">types of office set-ups</a> available in the modern working world, finding the best one for your team takes a lot of careful consideration.</p>
<p>Office space has the ability to inspire your employees, but only if it offers everything your team needs in their day-to-day work. One of the most popular office designs right now is the open plan office layout. But what exactly is it that is so appealing to business leaders and their teams?</p>
<p>In this blog post, Eden London shares its industry expertise with the top benefits of an open plan office layout.</p>
<h2>The open plan office</h2>
<p>Open plan living has become a popular choice for homeowners yearning for a more social and free-flowing space. This is a trend which has since migrated into the world of work, with hundreds of offices across the country now boasting the ‘open plan’ label.</p>
<p>But what <em>is</em> ‘open plan’?</p>
<p>Simply put, it’s a space—home, office or otherwise—which has large, open rooms with little or no internal dividing walls. This style of architecture and design has become popular due to the flow it can allow a space to achieve, the modern feel it can give and the increased light it offers.</p>
<p>With a great deal of the modern workforce yearning for a more relaxed and pleasant working environment, the open plan office has developed. Instead of smaller office spaces divided up and boxed off by walls and partitions, the open plan office layout provides a larger, lighter space, often segmented by features such as sofas and desks.</p>
<h2>The benefits of the open plan office layout</h2>
<p>There are many pros to an open plan office layout, including those which are both financial and social. Here are some of the main ways that this office design can benefit your business and its employees:</p>
<h3>Foster team relationships</h3>
<p>Any business needs strong team relationships for processes to be efficient and for productivity to be high. Teams who are physically divided by the office space are more likely to be emotionally divided too.</p>
<p>Think about it—if your employees work in a cubicle office environment, they’re more likely to send an email than they are to ask someone based in another room. But in the open plan office, where entire teams can work independently, while sharing the same space, you’re more likely to encourage face-to face interaction.</p>
<p>This is not only a far more efficient way of communicating things like questions and updates, it also helps to foster relationships between staff—which in turn can boost team performance.</p>
<h3>Room to grow</h3>
<p>One of the great things about open plan office layouts is that they are made for flexibility. Whether you want to move the furniture around to give your space a fresh feel, or need to introduce additional desks for new team members, open plan offices are great for businesses who are planning to expand.</p>
<p>As large open spaces with very little in the way of permanent internal features, such as walls, it’s possible to completely reconfigure the internal layout of your office to meet your needs, as and when they change.</p>
<p>There’s a financial benefit to this too—without needing to rent out more offices or pack up and move on entirely, the room to grow offered by open plan office layouts makes them great value for money in terms of their prospective longevity.</p>
<h3>Reduced construction cost</h3>
<p>If you’re looking to build your own office space, rather than move into a pre-existing one, then there’s benefits to open plan designs here, too. Other than the advantages of these office designs which we’ve already mentioned, open plan office layouts are also more financially economical to construct.</p>
<p>When it comes to the cost of constructing an office, the more physical building there is to do, the more it will cost in both materials and labour. From partition walls to light and carpet fittings, traditional office spaces require more work to bring up to standard.</p>
<p>Whereas, in open plan offices, the internal space is left largely untouched, with perhaps one flooring choice fitted and the internal walls painted, depending on the fit out option requested.</p>
<h2>Going open plan in your office</h2>
<p>Do the benefits of an open plan office layout appeal to you? Are you looking for a bespoke <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/projects/office-fit-outs/">office build or fit out</a> in or around London?</p>
<p>If so, Eden London can help. With years of experience in the construction industry, we have the skills and experience to design, build and fit out your office space on time and on budget.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The environment we find ourselves in can have an instant impact on our mood—and there is no place where this is more relevant than in the workplace. The design and layout of your company’s office has the potential to either </span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/336044"><span style="font-weight: 400;">help and hinder staff productivity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your office is due a redesign and fit out, it’s important to make choices that boost employee engagement and help you reap greater levels of productivity. In this blog post, we share our insight into some of the ways you can create an <a href="https://edenlondon.co.uk/projects/office-fit-outs/">office design</a> that inspires your employees.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reinventing the meeting room</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-much-time-do-we-spend-in-meetings-hint-its-scary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Muse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, managers spend anywhere between 35% and 50% of their time in meetings. With some of the workforce spending as much as half of their time in these spaces, ensuring they’re designed in a way which encourages employees to be inspired is key. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is especially true because the managers in the meeting rooms are often also the ones tasked with using this inspiration to lead and enthuse the rest of the team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But more often than not, meeting rooms are bland and dated spaces with four walls and a table with some chairs dotted around. Although this is more than adequate in terms of functionality, this isn’t exactly a great design for encouraging communication and creativity between those responsible for coming up with new ideas and devising business strategies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meeting rooms should be an inviting and comfortable space in which people can communicate freely. Spruce up the space with warm colours, comfortable furnishings and interactive whiteboards to encourage more collaboration and less chalk and talk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result? Everyone leaving the meeting space with the inspiration and enthusiasm to go out and motivate their team to reach the goals set. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redefining breakout spaces</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, </span><a href="https://www.studyfinds.org/office-worker-1700-hours-computer-screen/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">office workers spend around 1700 hours in front of a computer screen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> each year. This is a massive amount of time, and is something which can take its toll both mentally and physically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a responsible employer, it’s your job to give your team a suitable breakout space where they can kick back and relax away from the desk. But more often than not, break out spaces are small, dated rooms with a few old chairs, a blurring fridge and perhaps even a microwave—if you’re lucky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with </span><a href="https://www.neweggbusiness.com/smartbuyer/productivity/breakroom-essentials/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">better break rooms proven to lead to higher rates of employee productivity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, taking your lunch area back to the drawing board might be just what’s needed to inspire your team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some popular break room additions include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pool and foosball tables</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TVs and radios</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sofas </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quiet areas</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might think that giving your team more perks in the break room will lead to stretched out lunches and reduced levels of professionalism in the workplace. However, playing games, socialising and relaxing during lunch can in fact help your team clear their heads and improve their once when they return to their desk. You may also find relationships between co-workers improve, leading to better teamwork and in-office communication.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the light </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve got overhead lights in the office. That&#8217;s all you need, right? Think again—the type of light sources used in your office space can have a massive impact on the engagement, happiness and productivity of your employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where possible, you should always strive for as much natural light as possible. Whether each desk is positioned in front of a window or each team is positioned with a natural light outlook, it’s a fact that </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/study-natural-light-is-the-best-medicine-for-the-office-300590905.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">daylight light is the best medicine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it comes to inspiring employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this said, not every office can be re-designed with additional natural light sources. But this doesn’t mean your team should be kept in the dark. There’s multiple alternative options to inject light into any environment, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotlights</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bright wall colours</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Table lamps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Change existing bulbs</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Injecting colour</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to inspire your employees through office design, you need to offer something worth being inspired about. Although monochrome and neutral spaces might be the safe option for pleasing the masses, it certainly won’t motivate anyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But injecting colour will. From feature walls to furnishings, adding bursts of colour into your office space can lead to better brain stimulation, higher workplace morale and more productive teams. Coordinate this with your company branding to give the workplace a sense of identity</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eden London have the experience and expertise needed to bring the right colours into your office design. With years of experience in office fit outs, we have the skills to inject colour into your space in a tasteful and effective way.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any renovation process is a challenging but rewarding feat. From the financial bonus it can produce to the proud moment you step back to see a once tired and outdated building with a newly found lease of life, it’s easy to see why property renovation is addictive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most properties—residential or otherwise—usually require renovation work because they have been left unmaintained for quite a number of years. As such, most buildings that qualify for such projects are old—and some are really, really old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to this, many who take on the challenge of renovating a listed building aren’t just faced with the general hard work of a lengthy property facelift, they also have rules relating to specific listing regulations that they must legally adhere to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing what you can and can’t do when you’re renovating a listed building is half the battle for many new and eager renovators, and getting to grips with it all is something which takes seasoned property developers years to master.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in this blog post, we’ve done a lot of the hard work for you. As professionals in the construction industry, Eden London has years of experience working on protected buildings with special requirements. Read on for everything you should know before renovating a listed building.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a listed building?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with most things, the older a style building is, the less of them there are left. Whether they’ve been demolished to make way for more modern alternatives or fallen down over time, there’s now only a small percentage of buildings in the UK that pre-date the 1700’s which have—mostly—remained true to their original form.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, these buildings are usually protected by something called a ‘listing’. A listing, according to </span><a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/what-is-designation/listed-buildings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historic England</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is something that “marks and celebrates a building&#8217;s special architectural and historic interest, and also brings it under the consideration of the planning system, so that it can be protected for future generations”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What this means for any listed building is that, before making any changes or alterations to it, the owner must apply for </span><a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/hpg/consent/lbc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">listed building consent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While it’s not practical—or wise—for these relics to be frozen in time, as changes to buildings can increase their safety, appeal and longevity, a listing ensures that any work—such as a renovation—is carried out in keeping with the existing style.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Types of listing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a lover of old buildings and have just purchased a wobbly-walled cottage with the plan to strip it out and return it to its former glory, don’t worry if it’s listed. A listing can sound like a negative thing, but it’s in place to preserve architectural history for as long as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The listing given to a building depends on its considered importance.</span></p>
<p><b>Grade I: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are buildings which are deemed to be of exceptional interest. It’s estimated that no more than </span><a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/what-is-designation/listed-buildings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.5% </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">hold this listing. </span></p>
<p><b>Grade II:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Buildings which are considered to be of more than special interest, but not as important as those listed as Grade I are awarded Grade II. Around 5.8% of listed buildings are Grade II</span></p>
<p><b>Grade III: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grade II buildings are of special interest, however not to the same level as Grade I &amp; 2 listing. 91.7% of all listed buildings in the UK are in this class and this is the most likely grade of listing for a homeowner.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to know if a building is listed</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your property predates 1850, the chances are it’s listed. But if your renovation project is even 100 years old, there’s a chance it could still be a listed building. In fact, any building more than 30 years old could be listed, so it’s important to check before submitting any plans or carrying out any work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best—and most reliable—way to determine if your building is listed is to search the </span><a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Heritage List for England (NHLE).</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This site provides the only official, up to date register of all nationally protected historic buildings and sites in England, including listed buildings, but also details scheduled monuments, protected wrecks, registered parks and gardens, and even battlefields!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your building doesn’t appear on this list, you’re free to draw up your plans and get started with your renovation (subject to council approval). If, however, your building is confirmed to be listed, you need to think more carefully about your renovation plans.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listing restrictions</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you can and can’t do to a listed building can be a bit of a minefield. But a listing’s specific criteria is something you must adhere to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does sympathetic renovation ensure you maintain the original style of the building, not doing so is an offence that can result in court action and legal penalties.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the right people for the job</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to what’s at stake, renovating a listed building is rarely suitable for a first-timer project or DIY attempt. They required skilled craftsmen and clued-up building professionals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re planning on renovating a listed building, you need a team of knowledgeable experts on hand who have the skills and experience to bring your listed property back to life in line with regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With years of carrying out work on protected buildings behind them, Eden London has the experience and expertise needed to perform renovation activities on buildings of a listed status. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The global COVID-19 pandemic has restricted much of the building and construction industry over the last month, with the priority always being to protect the NHS and save lives.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Consumer habits are changing, and retailers are feeling the brunt of this alteration. With more shoppers opting for the online experience provided by the likes of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/07/almost-90-of-uk-shoppers-use-amazon-research-reveals">Amazon</a>, bricks-and-mortar stores are having to react to this change in demand if they want to survive.</p>
<p>A lot of things are changing in traditional retail, from the products stocked to the in-store experience, and one of the most obvious physical changes is the design of the shops themselves.</p>
<p>In this blog post specialist commercial contractors, Eden London, discusses how the future of shopping is set to change the look and design of the retail store, and how this is impacting construction firms.</p>
<h2>The need for change</h2>
<p>With online retail vastly <a href="https://www.consultancy.uk/news/21518/online-retail-growth-outpaces-bricks-and-mortar-footfall">outpacing</a> their bricks-and-mortar counterparts in recent years, the need for change in highstreet retail is clear.</p>
<p>The digital transformation is changing the habits of consumers. <a href="https://www.tigermobiles.com/blog/mobile-phone-usage-statistics/">94%</a> of UK adults now own a mobile device, and 43% of us pick our phones up within the first few minutes of waking up.</p>
<p>Our reliance on technology is something which influences our habits, including our preferred shopping experience. With the demand of customers changing, retailers must react. For traditional traders fighting to stay afloat in a market dominated by online competitors that offer ultimate convenience, this means a complete overhaul.</p>
<h3>Meeting consumer demand</h3>
<p>Being customer-centric is the key for retail stores wanting to retain their customers against the easy option of shopping online.</p>
<p>For highstreet shops looking for ways to stand out, increase footfall and maximise transaction value, it’s vital that every necessary step is being taken to meet the demand of the modern consumer.</p>
<p>Retail stores need to put themselves in the shoppers’ shoes, and consider why they are choosing to shop online and how this can be actioned in the in-store environment.</p>
<p>When customers shop online, they get:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed</strong> &#8211; In a couple of minutes a consumer can find what they want and make a purchase without needing to leave the house.</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong> &#8211; Unlike bricks-and-mortar stores, online shopping offers maximum availability of products, which are shipped to customers directly from the warehouse.</li>
<li><strong>Variety</strong> &#8211; Shopping online gives consumers the means to buy items from multiple suppliers sites.</li>
<li><strong>Ease</strong> &#8211; Consumers can make purchases without needing to visit their local town or city.</li>
<li><strong>Save</strong> &#8211; Online shopping allows customers to find the best priced products available on a global scale—not just what’s available on the local highstreet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The change</h2>
<p>But how can high street retailers compete? Simply, brands need to react to the change in consumer demands and provide equal—if not better—shopping experiences to that available online.</p>
<p>The transformation of brick-and-mortar stores is already underway, with maximising convenience spearheading the change.</p>
<p>Some examples include:</p>
<p><strong>Faster payments</strong> &#8211; many consumers want to pay for their items without the traditional queues.</p>
<p>Retail stores have since introduced mobile payments and self-scan options to meet this demand, with Amazon recently debuting its first supermarket with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/25/amazon-go-grocery-supermarket-seattle-technology">no checkouts</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In-store experiences</strong> &#8211; With shoppers able to easily purchase products online, highstreets need to offer something more.</p>
<p>Experience is the one thing a physical store has that ecommerce can’t match. Retailers are harnessing this, with in-store only brands like Primark now offering <a href="https://www.edp24.co.uk/business/norwich-primark-haymarket-new-store-beauty-salon-1-6350438">salon treatments</a> to customers.</p>
<p><strong>Store design</strong> &#8211; It’s now harder than ever to attract customers to bricks-and-mortar stores. As such, the visual appeal of stores—from their layout to their visual merchandising—is at the forefront.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.drapersonline.com/business-operations/stores/change-in-store-future-proofing-bricks-and-mortar/7039426.article">recent article by fashion retail specialists, Drapers</a>, has stressed the importance of attending to the appearance and design of stores in the battle against online competitors.</p>
<p><strong>Merging online and offline shopping</strong> &#8211; We’ve all heard the saying ‘if you can’t beat them, join them. And that’s exactly what shopping centres group, Intu, is doing.</p>
<p>Bringing online retail brands tangible, the firm has recently announced the opening of its <a href="https://fashionunited.uk/news/retail/intu-to-open-uk-s-first-store-dedicated-to-online-fashion-brands/2020030347772">first bricks-and-mortar store dedicated to online brands</a>.</p>
<h2>The impact on commercial contractors</h2>
<p>But how is the change in retail stores affecting commercial contractors? With the change in shopping habits forcing retailers to consider the appearance of their stores more than ever, the effect on the commercial construction industry is a positive one.</p>
<p>With many retail spaces installing new features, redecorating and in some cases, issuing completely new fit outs, specialist retail construction companies are in high demand.</p>
<p>With every brand looking for ways to stand out and attract attention, commercial contractors must be more creative in their plans for retail clients, providing new and exciting ideas that can help boost customers. Professional construction firms must ensure that these new designs are implemented at the highest standard, on time and on budget to result in maximum success.</p>
