From the financial bonus it can produce to the proud moment you step back to see a once tired and outdated building with a newly found lease of life, it\u2019s easy to see why property renovation is addictive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most properties\u2014residential or otherwise\u2014usually require renovation work because they have been left unmaintained for quite a number of years. As such, most buildings that qualify for such projects are old\u2014and some are really, really old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to this, many who take on the challenge of renovating a listed building aren\u2019t just faced with the general hard work of a lengthy property facelift, they also have rules relating to specific listing regulations that they must legally adhere to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing what you can and can\u2019t do when you\u2019re renovating a listed building is half the battle for many new and eager renovators, and getting to grips with it all is something which takes seasoned property developers years to master.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in this blog post, we\u2019ve done a lot of the hard work for you. As professionals in the construction industry, Eden London has years of experience working on protected buildings with special requirements. Read on for everything you should know before renovating a listed building.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a listed building?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with most things, the older a style building is, the less of them there are left. Whether they\u2019ve been demolished to make way for more modern alternatives or fallen down over time, there\u2019s now only a small percentage of buildings in the UK that pre-date the 1700\u2019s which have\u2014mostly\u2014remained true to their original form.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As such, these buildings are usually protected by something called a \u2018listing\u2019. A listing, according to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/historicengland.org.uk\/listing\/what-is-designation\/listed-buildings\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historic England<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is something that \u201cmarks and celebrates a building&#8217;s special architectural and historic interest, and also brings it under the consideration of the planning system, so that it can be protected for future generations\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What this means for any listed building is that, before making any changes or alterations to it, the owner must apply for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/historicengland.org.uk\/advice\/hpg\/consent\/lbc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">listed building consent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While it\u2019s not practical\u2014or wise\u2014for these relics to be frozen in time, as changes to buildings can increase their safety, appeal and longevity, a listing ensures that any work\u2014such as a renovation\u2014is carried out in keeping with the existing style.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Types of listing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re a lover of old buildings and have just purchased a wobbly-walled cottage with the plan to strip it out and return it to its former glory, don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s listed. A listing can sound like a negative thing, but it\u2019s in place to preserve architectural history for as long as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The listing given to a building depends on its considered importance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Grade I: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are buildings which are deemed to be of exceptional interest. It\u2019s estimated that no more than <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/historicengland.org.uk\/listing\/what-is-designation\/listed-buildings\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.5% <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hold this listing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Grade II:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Buildings which are considered to be of more than special interest, but not as important as those listed as Grade I are awarded Grade II. Around 5.8% of listed buildings are Grade II<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Grade III: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grade II buildings are of special interest, however not to the same level as Grade I &amp; 2 listing. 91.7% of all listed buildings in the UK are in this class and this is the most likely grade of listing for a homeowner.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to know if a building is listed<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your property predates 1850, the chances are it\u2019s listed. But if your renovation project is even 100 years old, there\u2019s a chance it could still be a listed building. In fact, any building more than 30 years old could be listed, so it\u2019s important to check before submitting any plans or carrying out any work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best\u2014and most reliable\u2014way to determine if your building is listed is to search the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/historicengland.org.uk\/listing\/the-list\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The National Heritage List for England (NHLE).<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This site provides the only official, up to date register of all nationally protected historic buildings and sites in England, including listed buildings, but also details scheduled monuments, protected wrecks, registered parks and gardens, and even battlefields!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your building doesn\u2019t appear on this list, you\u2019re free to draw up your plans and get started with your renovation (subject to council approval). If, however, your building is confirmed to be listed, you need to think more carefully about your renovation plans.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listing restrictions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What you can and can\u2019t do to a listed building can be a bit of a minefield. But a listing\u2019s specific criteria is something you must adhere to.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only does sympathetic renovation ensure you maintain the original style of the building, not doing so is an offence that can result in court action and legal penalties.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding the right people for the job<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to what\u2019s at stake, renovating a listed building is rarely suitable for a first-timer project or DIY attempt. They required skilled craftsmen and clued-up building professionals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re planning on renovating a listed building, you need a team of knowledgeable experts on hand who have the skills and experience to bring your listed property back to life in line with regulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With years of carrying out work on protected buildings behind them, Eden London has the experience and expertise needed to perform renovation activities on buildings of a listed status.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consistently delivering high-standard work on time and on budget, Eden London is a reliable, friendly team who can help make your dreams of renovating a listed building a reality.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To find out more about us and how we can help with your listed building renovation, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/edenlondon.co.uk\/contact-us\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">get in touch with us <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">today.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Any renovation process is a challenging but rewarding feat.
