One of the most popular office designs right now is the open plan office layout. But what exactly is it that is so appealing to business leaders and their teams?<\/p>\n<p>In this blog post, Eden London shares its industry expertise with the top benefits of an open plan office layout.<\/p>\n<h2>The open plan office<\/h2>\n<p>Open plan living has become a popular choice for homeowners yearning for a more social and free-flowing space. This is a trend which has since migrated into the world of work, with hundreds of offices across the country now boasting the \u2018open plan\u2019 label.<\/p>\n<p>But what <em>is<\/em> \u2018open plan\u2019?<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, it\u2019s a space\u2014home, office or otherwise\u2014which has large, open rooms with little or no internal dividing walls. This style of architecture and design has become popular due to the flow it can allow a space to achieve, the modern feel it can give and the increased light it offers.<\/p>\n<p>With a great deal of the modern workforce yearning for a more relaxed and pleasant working environment, the open plan office has developed. Instead of smaller office spaces divided up and boxed off by walls and partitions, the open plan office layout provides a larger, lighter space, often segmented by features such as sofas and desks.<\/p>\n<h2>The benefits of the open plan office layout<\/h2>\n<p>There are many pros to an open plan office layout, including those which are both financial and social. Here are some of the main ways that this office design can benefit your business and its employees:<\/p>\n<h3>Foster team relationships<\/h3>\n<p>Any business needs strong team relationships for processes to be efficient and for productivity to be high. Teams who are physically divided by the office space are more likely to be emotionally divided too.<\/p>\n<p>Think about it\u2014if your employees work in a cubicle office environment, they\u2019re more likely to send an email than they are to ask someone based in another room. But in the open plan office, where entire teams can work independently, while sharing the same space, you\u2019re more likely to encourage face-to face interaction.<\/p>\n<p>This is not only a far more efficient way of communicating things like questions and updates, it also helps to foster relationships between staff\u2014which in turn can boost team performance.<\/p>\n<h3>Room to grow<\/h3>\n<p>One of the great things about open plan office layouts is that they are made for flexibility. Whether you want to move the furniture around to give your space a fresh feel, or need to introduce additional desks for new team members, open plan offices are great for businesses who are planning to expand.<\/p>\n<p>As large open spaces with very little in the way of permanent internal features, such as walls, it\u2019s possible to completely reconfigure the internal layout of your office to meet your needs, as and when they change.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a financial benefit to this too\u2014without needing to rent out more offices or pack up and move on entirely, the room to grow offered by open plan office layouts makes them great value for money in terms of their prospective longevity.<\/p>\n<h3>Reduced construction cost<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to build your own office space, rather than move into a pre-existing one, then there\u2019s benefits to open plan designs here, too. Other than the advantages of these office designs which we\u2019ve already mentioned, open plan office layouts are also more financially economical to construct.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to the cost of constructing an office, the more physical building there is to do, the more it will cost in both materials and labour. From partition walls to light and carpet fittings, traditional office spaces require more work to bring up to standard.<\/p>\n<p>Whereas, in open plan offices, the internal space is left largely untouched, with perhaps one flooring choice fitted and the internal walls painted, depending on the fit out option requested.<\/p>\n<h2>Going open plan in your office<\/h2>\n<p>Do the benefits of an open plan office layout appeal to you?
