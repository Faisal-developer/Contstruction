In this blog post, we use our industry insight to outline some of the best sustainable materials for low carbon buildings right now.<\/p>\n<h2>What makes a material sustainable?<\/h2>\n<p>So, you\u2019re interested in creating your dream new build or improving your existing space? That\u2019s great\u2014low carbon buildings are a great way to reduce your impact on the environment.<\/p>\n<p>But what makes a construction material sustainable? Sustainable materials are those which have a relatively positive impact on communities and the environment which are used to manufacture them. These materials should provide environmental, social and economic benefits while protecting the environment over their entire life cycle, from their manufacture to their final disposal.<\/p>\n<p>In construction, as well as in other industries, the less that needs to be done to the material before it can be used usually makes it more sustainable and means it has a lower carbon footprint. This is because less energy expenditure has taken place to get the material ready for use.<\/p>\n<h2>Compressed earth blocks<\/h2>\n<p>This might seem a bit prehistoric, but using compressed earth which is stabilized into blocks is a great alternative to other building materials used in masonry.<\/p>\n<p>Compressed earth blocks are a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to the popular clay brick, which requires a burning treatment at high temperatures to become durable.<\/p>\n<p>Earth blocks can offer similar strength when used in wall structures, but are manufactured by compacting soil, sand, a stabiliser\u2014usually cement or lime\u2014and water. This process saves approximately 60-70% more energy than that used in the manufacture of clay bricks.<\/p>\n<h2>Timber<\/h2>\n<p>Both a natural product and requiring little treatment in preparation for use, this construction industry staple is luckily also fairly sustainable. Often repurposed wood from other constructions, using timber for your building project is one of the easiest ways to boost your sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, timber can be easily recycled and reused, having very little long-term impact on the environment. However, it\u2019s important to note that adding finishes to protect these materials increases their overall impact\u2014some varnishes for wood can limit its recyclability!<\/p>\n<h2>Recycled Steel<\/h2>\n<p>Steel is one of the strongest construction materials out there, with this material making up the joists that keep buildings standing. But producing and smelting steel takes a considerable amount of energy, and although it\u2019s long lasting, it\u2019s far from eco-friendly to produce.<\/p>\n<p>But steel can be sustainable and come with a low carbon footprint. Utilising steel already in existence for beams, joists and more in your build can help reduce the need for newly produced materials, cutting energy costs by as much as 75%.<\/p>\n<h2>Going green<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to create a sustainable and low carbon building, get in touch with Eden London today.
