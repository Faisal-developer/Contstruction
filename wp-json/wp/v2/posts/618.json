Keeping staff morale and productivity in the office high through refurbishment is a popular option, but one which takes time and good organisation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unless you\u2019re a professional refurbishment contractor, knowing exactly what needs to be done and all the things you need to think about when carrying out an office refurbishment is a big task. In this blog post, the team at Eden has put together the ultimate office refurbishment checklist to help see your office upgrade from start to finish in a smooth and stress-free way.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Timing is everything<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting the timing right for your office refurbishment is vital to not only its success, but also to ensure minimal disruption to the team who work there. You need to sit down with all key decision-makers in your team to come to agreement on the best timing for your refurbishment project.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the potential need for reconfigurations, painting and building work which could lead to excessive noise and dust which limit your employee\u2019s access to the office, this is something crucial to get right for minimal down time of your team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this reason, office refurbishments are particularly popular at times when offices have shut-downs or when all staff are away from the office, such as the Christmas period. Carrying out office updates during periods when your team are away from the office means that work isn\u2019t disrupted and they come back after a refreshing holiday to a brand new office space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But be warned\u2014the demand for office refurbishments during key periods mean that office fit out teams are booked up fast. To make sure you\u2019re front on the queue for your office refurbishment when your staff have time off, you need to get in quick ans book your work far in advance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outline the aims of your refurbishment<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason why you\u2019re carrying out an office refurbishment might seem obvious\u2014to update and modernise your space. But there\u2019s far more to it than simply redecorating what\u2019s already there.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From increased functionality of the office space to reconfiguration to improved lighting, knowing the desired outcome for your space before refurbishment starts is key.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the finer details, such as adding pops of colour, decor and furniture are important aspects to consider, having a complete checklist of exactly what you want your refurbishment to achieve before the construction team turn up to start the process is key to ensuring there\u2019s enough time to fully explore and discuss the available options which your chosen contractors.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make time to crunch the numbers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve got big plans for your office space, it\u2019s easy to get carried away. But taking time to crunch the numbers and set yourself a budget is imperative to getting everything you want and need done with the resources you have available.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Money doesn\u2019t grow on trees and whatever your price point for the refurbishment project, there will be a need to do the calculations to ensure you come in on budget.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you choose to manage the cost of your project yourself or enlist the help of your office refurbishment contractors, knowing what you want to achieve and the budget you have to bring that vision to life needs to be established early on.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find your fit out team<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s hundreds of construction service providers in every corner of the UK, and each has their own specialisms. It\u2019s important to find your perfect fit\u2014and this means not opting for the first company you land on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding the right team for your refurbishment project requires careful research into everything from services provided, the cost of these services, previous work and client testimonials.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure you stay clear of the cowboys, and receive a high-standard office refurbishment sure to impress your office employees, investing the time and effort needed to find an accredited, tried-and-trusted <a href=\"https:\/\/edenlondon.co.uk\/projects\/office-fit-outs\/\">office fit out provider<\/a> is crucial to ensuring you get the expected result, on time and on budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Eden London today<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you looking for a principal contractor with a proven track record for bringing office spaces in London and Essex back to life? <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/edenlondon.co.uk\/contact-us\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Eden London today<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to see how we can help you bring life back into your office through professional and premium refurbishments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Office refurbishments are a complex and time-consuming process, but one which can help breathe new life into your work environment.
