The design and layout of your company\u2019s office has the potential to either <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/336044\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">help and hinder staff productivity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your office is due a redesign and fit out, it\u2019s important to make choices that boost employee engagement and help you reap greater levels of productivity. In this blog post, we share our insight into some of the ways you can create an <a href=\"https:\/\/edenlondon.co.uk\/projects\/office-fit-outs\/\">office design<\/a> that inspires your employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reinventing the meeting room<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.themuse.com\/advice\/how-much-time-do-we-spend-in-meetings-hint-its-scary\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Muse<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, managers spend anywhere between 35% and 50% of their time in meetings. With some of the workforce spending as much as half of their time in these spaces, ensuring they\u2019re designed in a way which encourages employees to be inspired is key.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is especially true because the managers in the meeting rooms are often also the ones tasked with using this inspiration to lead and enthuse the rest of the team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But more often than not, meeting rooms are bland and dated spaces with four walls and a table with some chairs dotted around. Although this is more than adequate in terms of functionality, this isn\u2019t exactly a great design for encouraging communication and creativity between those responsible for coming up with new ideas and devising business strategies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meeting rooms should be an inviting and comfortable space in which people can communicate freely. Spruce up the space with warm colours, comfortable furnishings and interactive whiteboards to encourage more collaboration and less chalk and talk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result? Everyone leaving the meeting space with the inspiration and enthusiasm to go out and motivate their team to reach the goals set.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redefining breakout spaces<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On average, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.studyfinds.org\/office-worker-1700-hours-computer-screen\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">office workers spend around 1700 hours in front of a computer screen<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> each year. This is a massive amount of time, and is something which can take its toll both mentally and physically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a responsible employer, it\u2019s your job to give your team a suitable breakout space where they can kick back and relax away from the desk. But more often than not, break out spaces are small, dated rooms with a few old chairs, a blurring fridge and perhaps even a microwave\u2014if you\u2019re lucky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.neweggbusiness.com\/smartbuyer\/productivity\/breakroom-essentials\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">better break rooms proven to lead to higher rates of employee productivity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, taking your lunch area back to the drawing board might be just what\u2019s needed to inspire your team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some popular break room additions include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pool and foosball tables<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TVs and radios<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sofas\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quiet areas<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might think that giving your team more perks in the break room will lead to stretched out lunches and reduced levels of professionalism in the workplace. However, playing games, socialising and relaxing during lunch can in fact help your team clear their heads and improve their once when they return to their desk. You may also find relationships between co-workers improve, leading to better teamwork and in-office communication.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding the light\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ve got overhead lights in the office. That&#8217;s all you need, right? Think again\u2014the type of light sources used in your office space can have a massive impact on the engagement, happiness and productivity of your employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where possible, you should always strive for as much natural light as possible. Whether each desk is positioned in front of a window or each team is positioned with a natural light outlook, it\u2019s a fact that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/study-natural-light-is-the-best-medicine-for-the-office-300590905.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">daylight light is the best medicine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when it comes to inspiring employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this said, not every office can be re-designed with additional natural light sources. But this doesn\u2019t mean your team should be kept in the dark. There\u2019s multiple alternative options to inject light into any environment, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spotlights<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bright wall colours<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Table lamps<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Change existing bulbs<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Injecting colour<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to inspire your employees through office design, you need to offer something worth being inspired about. Although monochrome and neutral spaces might be the safe option for pleasing the masses, it certainly won\u2019t motivate anyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But injecting colour will. From feature walls to furnishings, adding bursts of colour into your office space can lead to better brain stimulation, higher workplace morale and more productive teams. Coordinate this with your company branding to give the workplace a sense of identity<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eden London have the experience and expertise needed to bring the right colours into your office design.
