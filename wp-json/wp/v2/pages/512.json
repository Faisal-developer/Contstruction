It typically takes place in two parts, the first of which happens over the phone and the second involves a site visit or a face-to-face meeting.<\/p>\n<p>The purpose of the consultation is to discuss the objectives and specifications of the project, so that we can determine whether we are a suitable fit and if so, gather enough information to provide an approximate cost.<\/p>\n<h2>How can I prepare?<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s be clear: the initial consultation should not feel intimidating. You\u2019re not being quizzed on your construction knowledge, and if your answer to some of our questions is \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, we\u2019re here to help you figure this out.<\/p>\n<p>However, there are a number of things we\u2019d recommend prospective clients think about prior to the initial consultation. This is simply to make the conversation as productive as possible. The more information we can ascertain from you about the project, the more accurate our guidance and our pricing will be.<\/p>\n<h3>Do you have a set of drawings?<\/h3>\n<p>What stage is your project at? Is this still in the exploratory stage or have you begun the process by getting drawings made up\u2014often with a view to applying for planning permission.<\/p>\n<p>Having drawings is absolutely not a necessity for the initial consultation. If you require these, we can provide a full design and build service.<\/p>\n<h3>Do you have or require planning permission?<\/h3>\n<p>Many internal fit-out projects, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/edenlondon.co.uk\/projects\/office-fit-outs\/\">office fit outs<\/a>, will not require planning permission unless you\u2019re doing external changes, but it\u2019s worth investigating this beforehand. If, for example, you want to change a <a href=\"https:\/\/edenlondon.co.uk\/projects\/commercial-property-conversions\/\">commercial to residential<\/a> premises which includes a change of use, this will likely require planning permission.<\/p>\n<p>We can manage the process of applying for planning permission if necessary.<\/p>\n<h3>Do you have a budget in mind?<\/h3>\n<p>We often find that individuals that have not undertaken these types of projects before underestimate the potential cost. It\u2019s important to be realistic about the desired budget so we can advise to the best of our ability. This will also save you some nasty surprises when it comes to pricing!<\/p>\n<h2>What outcome can I expect?<\/h2>\n<p>The outcome of the consultation will depend on whether it appears we are the correct people to assist you. We have a <a href=\"https:\/\/edenlondon.co.uk\/case-studies\/\">diverse portfolio<\/a> and plenty of experience, but that doesn\u2019t make us the right contractor for every project. It\u2019s important that everyone feels that we are the best-placed team to realise your idea.<\/p>\n<p>If we believe ourselves to be the right fit following the telephone consultation, we will usually follow up with a visit to your site or premises. Should everything be good to go ahead, we will then use the information you have provided to determine a price.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is an initial consultation?
